            <h1 class="article_subtitle">The Wonder of Mazes</h1>
            <p class ="article_paragraph">Mazes have fascinated humanity for centuries, serving as both puzzles and metaphors 
                for life’s complexities. From ancient labyrinths to modern video games, 
                they challenge and inspire us.</p>
            <h1 class="article_subtitle">A Brief History</h1>
            <p class ="article_paragraph">Mazes date back to antiquity, with the most famous being 
                the Labyrinth of Crete, built by Daedalus to imprison the Minotaur. In ancient Egypt, 
                labyrinthine structures were carved into tombs to protect the deceased from grave 
                robbers and symbolize the journey to the afterlife. The Romans incorporated maze 
                designs into intricate mosaic floors, possibly used for religious or entertainment 
                purposes. During the Renaissance, elaborate hedge mazes became popular in European 
                gardens, offering amusement and intrigue to nobility. By the 18th and 19th centuries, 
                hedge mazes were widely embraced as decorative and recreational features in parks and 
                estates, laying the foundation for modern corn mazes and maze-based attractions.</p>
            <h1 class="article_subtitle">Why Mazes Captivate Us</h1>
            <p class ="article_paragraph">Mazes engage our problem-solving instincts and are used in psychological studies 
                to understand learning and memory. They also symbolize life’s unpredictable paths, 
                appearing in literature and film as metaphors for personal growth.</p>
            <h1 class="article_subtitle">Modern Mazes</h1>
            <p class ="article_paragraph">Today, mazes exist in video games, virtual reality, and AI navigation. They entertain, 
                educate, and aid in technology, from robotic vacuums to rescue drones.</p>
            <h1 class="article_subtitle">The Enduring Appeal</h1>
            <p class ="article_paragraph">Mazes remind us that every problem has a solution—sometimes requiring patience and 
                strategy. Whether real or metaphorical, navigating a maze is as rewarding as finding 
                the way out.</p>
